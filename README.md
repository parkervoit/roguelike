# Roguelike Game Written in Python
I am following [this tutorial here](http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/part-1/) 

The only two non-standard python libraries used in this project are [tcod](https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/).

## Why am I doing this?
I making this roguelike game to further develop my OOP skills and other coding best practices. My goal is to develop a standalone rogue-like game with custom story prompts and functionality beyond what is included in the tutorial

## What's the game?
I have always been a fan of Jonathon Coulton's song Code Monkey, and punching away at the code for this game made me feel like an ape on a keyboard! It's a procedurally generated rougelike dungeon crawler, complete with fog of war. Once I finish this tutorial, I'd like to eventually add a story and generally keep expanding the codebase.
