# Roguelike Game Written in Python
I am following [this tutorial here](http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/part-1/) \n

The only two non-standard python libraries used in this project are [tcod](https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/).\n

## Why am I doing this?
I making this roguelike game to further develop my OOP skills and other coding best practices. My goal is to develop a standalone rogue-like game with custom story prompts and functionality beyond what is included in the tutorial
